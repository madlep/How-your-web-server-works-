## Web servers are boring unless they're doing something ##

Apache doesn't do much on it's own

But has *lots* of open source community activity

Many modules to plug in to do almost anything
- Caching
- Custom headers
- Authentication
- Static file serving
- Whatever

**Being on the beaten track has it's advantages**
